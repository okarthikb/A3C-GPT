## A3CGPT

Train GPT with A3C. Because why not (it sucks tbh)...

The actor and critic are part of the same LM class (`nn.Linear`s). The critic `V` maps context embeddings to a single scalar value. The actor `Ï€` maps them to a single probability distribution (P(next token)). Choose random action (token) with probability `epsilon` (epsilon-greedy) and with probability `1 - epsilon)` let actor choose token - if token is correct, reward is `1 - p`, if wrong, `-p` (where `p` is predicted probability for that token).
